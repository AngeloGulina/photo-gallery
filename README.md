# Vue JS Photo Gallery

This repository contains a photo gallery written with VueJS. It's easy to use and lightweight. 
This repository aims to deliver a ready to use gallery for your project without plugins
or whatnot in order to accomplish a simple task like this.

# How to install

Piece of cake!
* Download this repository, or clone it
* Install `node` if you don't have it
* Run `lessc less/gallery.less > css/gallery.css` if you change the style or whatever
* Try the demo using `index.html`

# Why VueJS

It's a good alternative to the current caos of AngulaJS, hoping that v2 will fix everything.
Also I'm not a fan of the Shadow DOM of ReactJS. VueJS provide the right tools for the right tasks on the web
It takes the best from AngularJS and ReactJS. More info on [VueJS Official Site](http://vuejs.org/)

# Features

* You can handle multiple albums in one single page
* `Next` and `Previous` links scoped to the current album
* CSS mobile ready, the photo gallery is responsive
* Close button
* No jQuery or query DOM needed
