# Why VueJS

It's a good alternative to the current caos of AngulaJS, hoping that v2 will fix everything.
Also I'm not a fan of the Shadow DOM of ReactJS. VueJS provide the right tools for the right tasks on the web
It takes the best from AngularJS and ReactJS.

# Features

* You can handle multiple albums in one single page
* `Next` and `Previous` link scoped to the current album
* CSS mobile ready, the photo gallery is responsive
* Close button
* No jQuery or query DOM needed
